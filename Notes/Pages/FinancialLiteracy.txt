Financial Literacy

What is financial literacy?
Knowing how to handle your money wisely.

Budget
A plan that helps with managing money.

Why have a budget?
Keep track of where money is coming from and where it is going, limit excess expenditures, achieve financial goals.

50/30/20 Rule
50% Needs, 30% Wants, 20% Savings

I think this might need to be rescaled if your income goes up. I wouldn't recommend 20% savings rate at 200k income, for example.
I personally recommend that you save as much as you are willing to afford, depending on your age and where you are in life. It depends on what your personal values are, and what you deem as important in your financial and life journey.

Balancing a Budget

Having a negative balance in the budget means you spent more than you made. No good.
Having a positive balance means you spent less than you made. Not bad.
Having a zero balance means you spent what you made.

If you want a bigger pie for your budget, you have two options:
*Increase your income, or
*Decreases your expenses.

Some way to decrease expenses:
*Decrease need expenses
 *Buy things at cheaper unit price
 *Negotiate with service providers for a lower bill - research competitor pricing first.
*Decrease want expenses
 *Pack lunch
 *Enjoy free activities more
