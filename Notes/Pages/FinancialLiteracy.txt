50/30/20 Rule
50% Needs, 30% Wants, 20% Savings

I think this might need to be rescaled if your income goes up. I wouldn't recommend 20% savings rate at 200k income, for example.
I tend to figure out first what I want my savings to be, and then calculate how much I have in terms of needs, and the rest is just my wants. This works out okay if you have good income.
